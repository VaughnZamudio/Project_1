  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <h2>Vaughn Zamudio</h2>
    <p>Hey! I'm Vaughn Zamudio! I'm a first-year Game Design and Experiential Media Major.</p>
    <p>I'm a big fan of table tennis and I'm vice president of the IIT Table Tennis Club. But when it comes to sports, baseball is my real love. Having lived in Chicago my whole life, I cheer for both the Cubs and the Sox (controversial, I know). </p>
	<p>My music taste is all over the place and constantly changing, but right now, I'm really into classic and psychedelic rock.<p>
	<p>I also love to read—whether it’s classics (Dickens and Twain are favorites), fantasy, or manga. Lately, I’ve been hooked on Jujutsu Kaisen.<p>
	<p>I love anything funny, especially humor that feels natural or completely unexpected. That’s probably why I enjoy improv comedy, and one of my favorites from that is the Middleditch and Schwartz show on Netflix. If something surprises me and makes me laugh or smile, I'll usually remember it for longer and suggest it to others.<p>
